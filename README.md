It is intended to develop an information system with a web interface for project management. There are only two types of permissions in the context of a project: the coordinator and the common users. Users may be associated with multiple projects. Each project has a team, task lists, and also a discussion forum for members of the project. Task lists can be organized into groups. Associated with each task can also be comments from other users. It is important to keep track of the user that defined the task as well as the user who completed it.

This project intends to specify, develop and promote an information system available through the web for the management of collections of books, films, music albums, slides and their users.

We think that, nowadays, it would be useful to have an application that allows users to manage all items and their loans. Collections are physically distributed across multiple locations and the system will aggregate all items in a virtual library accessible to all users.

The platform will have an adaptive design, allowing the user to have a pleasant browsing experience, regardless of the access device (desktop, tablet or smartphone). The technology used will also allow fluent usage in navigation and provide an excellent user experience. In this way, the search engines will be fast and assertive, allowing users to easily search items.

Users are separated into groups with different permissions. There must be administration usage profiles, with all the privileges of access and modification. There also must be registered users usage profiles, with privileges to enter information, requests and returns of individual items, consult the information, register comments for the items and evaluate the items.
