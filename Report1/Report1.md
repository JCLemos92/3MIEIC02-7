# A1: Project management

This project intends to develop an information system with a web interface to be used in managment, objective setting and task scheduling  in scope of project development.

Nowadays, with the amount of task and to do list apps available in the market for both singular users and groups (wunderlist is an example of one of this apps), we decided it could be helpfull to implement out take on the matter focusing more not in the use of to do lists but in full project development.

We intend to make the platform available to a wide range of devices (desktop, tablet or smartphone), with an easy to use interface that allows easy and fast search of available projects, done and to be completed tasks and eventually warn the user of tasks that he has to do (if he is a regular user) and task that have been done by other users (if you are the creator of the task at hand).

All users are the equal and have the same permissions, when a user creates a project ha becomes that project coordinator, being able to set it's information and define the size of the development team, adding and removing users from the team at will or making the project available allowing interested users to join the team. Users that join the development team are considered common users and can post on the project forum as well as create and choose tasks for the project.
