Our website is responsive, so the layout adjust according to the screen size. All pages contain breadcrumbs and the same navbar. The whole website follow the same design, which is a white background, black text, blue buttons and details in orange to separate the site sections. These features makes ProPlan easy to use and make sure a great experience to users.
