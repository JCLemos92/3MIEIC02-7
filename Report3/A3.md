# A3: User Interface Prototype
 
This user interfaces prototype (or horizontal prototype) has the following goals:

    Help to identify and describe the user requirements, and raise new ones;
    Preview and empirically test the user interface of the product to be developed;
    Enable quick and multiple iterations on the design of the user interface.

This artefact includes three elements:

    Overview of the interface elements and features common to all pages;
    Overview of the information system from the viewpoint of the users (sitemap); and
    Identification and description of the main interactions with the system (at least two), organized as sequences of screens (storyboards).

The interface's descriptions are presented on the end of the document.

Figure 1: Interface's guidelines.

The figure above show our website homepage, for desktops and mobiles. The common features to all pages are highlighted.

  Our website is responsive, so the layout adjust according to the screen size
  sasa

    It was decided to stay within web conventions and use the default dark blue color for all links between interface pages.
    The common links to the various pages maintain their position to make the user experience consistent.
    Different sections have clearly distinct styles in order to highlight distinct hierarchies of information, and assist with the visual flow.

 
## 2. Sitemap
 
Sitemap ia a flow chart diagram that shows connections between web pages, giving a overall structure of the web aplication.
A visual sitemap is useful for both website users and developers, users can see how to navegate into the site, and developers can easily understand how the information hierachy works.
